\section{Modeling Network Structure}
\label{sec:Experiments}
In this section, we evaluate the effectiveness of \texttt{ARW} in preserving
structural properties of network datasets described in~\Cref{sec:Datasets}.
relative to eight state-of-the-art growth models.
% In~\Cref{sub:Experimental Setup}, we begin by describing existing growth models and the evaluation metrics
% used in the experiments. Then, we discuss our results.

\subsection{Setup}
\label{sub:Experimental Setup}

% We first briefly summarize the existing models used in the experiments.
In this subsection, we describe the state-of-the-art, representative growth models
and evaluation metrics used to fit these growth models to network datasets.

\textit{State-of-the-art Growth Models}. We compare \texttt{ARW} to eight state-of-the-art
growth models representative of the key edge formation
mechanisms: preferential attachment, fitness, triangle closing and random walks.
Two of the eight models account for attribute homophily and preserve attribute mixing patterns,
as listed below:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item{\textbf{Dorogovtsev-Mendes-Samukhin model}} \cite{dorogovtsev2000structure}  (\texttt{DMS})
	is a preferential attachment model that generates directed scale-free graphs. In this model,
	the probability of linking to a node is proportional to the sum of its in-degree and ``initial attractiveness.''

	\item{\textbf{Relay Linking model}} \cite{singh2017relay} (\texttt{RL}) propose a set of
	preferential attachment models for directed networks, which use relay linking to explain the change in
	node popularity over time. We use the iterated preferential relay-cite (IPRC) variant, which best fits
	real-world network properties.

	\item{\textbf{Kim-Altmann model}} \cite{kim2017effect} (\texttt{KA}) is a fitness-based model that defines
	fitness as the product of degree and attribute similarity. It can generate \textit{attributed} networks
	with assortative mixing and heavy tailed degree distribution.
	To generate directed networks, we modify \texttt{KA} to form directed edges to nodes in proportion to their in-degree.

	\item{\textbf{Holme-Kim model}} \cite{holme2002growing} (\texttt{HK}) is a preferential attachment model
	that generates scale-free, clustered, undirected networks using an additional triangle-closing mechanism.
	We modify the model to create directed edges and thereby generate directed networks.
	To generate directed networks, we modify \texttt{HK} to form directed edges to nodes in proportion to their in-degree
	and close triangles in their undirected 1-hop neighborhood.


	\item{\textbf{Social Attribute Network model}} \cite{gong2012evolution} (\texttt{SAN}) generates
	scale-free, attributed networks with high clustering using attribute-augmented
	preferential attachment and triangle closing mechanisms.
	We modify the model to create directed edges and thereby generate directed networks. We also note that
	the edge formation mechanism in \texttt{SAN} considerably simplifies for bibliographic network datasets,
	wherein all edges are formed at once.

	\item{\textbf{Herera-Zufiria model}} \cite{saramaki2004scale} (\texttt{SK})
	is a random walk model that generates scale-free, undirected networks with tunable average clustering.
	In order to generate directed networks, we allow the random walk mechanism in \texttt{SK} to traverse edges in any direction.

	\item{\textbf{Saramaki-Kaski}} \cite{herrera2011generating} (\texttt{HZ}) is a random walk model
	that generates scale-free networks with tunable average local clustering. To generate directed networks,
	we modify \texttt{HZ} to allow its random walk mechanism to traverse edges in any direction.

	\item{\textbf{Forest Fire model}} \cite{leskovec2005graphs} (\texttt{FF}) is a recursive random walk model
	that can generate directed networks with properties such ash shrinking diameter over time,
	heavy-tailed degree distributions and high clustering.

\textit{Ensuring Fair Comparison}. To ensure fair comparison, we modify existing models in three ways.
First, for \texttt{DMS}, \texttt{SAN}, \texttt{KA}, which do not have an explicitly defined initial graph,
we use the initialization method used for \texttt{ARW}, described in~\Cref{sub:Model Fitting}. Second, we extend
models that use constant node outdegree $m$ by increasing outdegree over time $m(t)$
using the method described in~\Cref{sub:Model Fitting}. In the absence of model-specific parameter estimation methods,
we use a grid search method to estimate the parameters of every network model, including \texttt{ARW},
using evaluation metrics and selection criterion described below.

\textit{Evaluation Metrics}.
We evaluate the network model fit by comparing four key global network properties of ${G}$ and $\hat{G}$:
degree distribution, local clustering distribution, degree-clustering relationship
and attribute assortativity. We use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (\texttt{KS}) statistic to compare the univariate degree
\& local clustering distributions. We compare the bivariate degree-clustering relationship in $G$ and $\hat{G}$ using
Weighted Relative Error (\texttt{WRE}), which aggregates the relative error
between the average local clustering $c(k)$ and $\hat{c}(k)$ of nodes with in-degree $k$
in $G$ and $\hat{G}$ respectively; The relative error between $c(k)$ and $\hat{c}(k)$
is weighted in proportion to the number of nodes with in-degree $k$ in $G$.

Jointly preserving multiple structural properties is a multi-objective optimization
problem; model parameters that accurately preserve the degree distribution
(i.e. low \texttt{KS} statistic) may not preserve the clustering distribution.
Therefore, for each model, the selection criterion for the grid search parameter estimation method
chooses the model parameters that minimizes the $\ell^2$-norm of the aforementioned evaluation metrics.
Since the metrics have different scales, we normalize the metrics before computing the $\ell^2$-norm
to prevent unwanted bias towards any particular metric.
We note that the parameter sensitivity of the Forest Fire (\texttt{FF}) model necessitates
a manually guided grid search method.

		% Although \texttt{SAN} preserves the univariate in-degree
		% and local clustering distributions, it does not account for the correlation between in-degree and clustering.
		Moreover, the triangle closing mechanism in \texttt{SAN} cannot explain why low in-degree nodes have high local clustering, thereby incurring high
		\texttt{WRE}. \texttt{ARW} outperforms existing network models

\subsection{Results}
\label{sub:Experimental Results}

Now, we evaluate the performance of \texttt{ARW} relative to eight well-known
existing models on the datasets introduced in~\Cref{sec:Datasets}.
\Cref{fig:exp_table} tabulates the evaluation metrics for every pair of model
and dataset. These metrics measure the accuracy with which the fitted models
preserve key global network properties: degree distribution, local clustering distribution,
and indegree-clustering relationship.
% We do not compare the extent to which these models preserve attribute
% assortativity because the attribute related model parameters can be
% independently tuned up to arbitrary precision. Instead,

To evaluate the performance of these models, we first fit each model
to all network datasets $G$ in~\Cref{sec:Datasets}.
Thereafter, we compare the structural properties of network dataset $G$ and network $\hat{G}$
generated by the fitted model using evaluation metrics in~\Cref{sub:Experimental Setup}. We average out
fluctuations in $\hat{G}$ over 100 runs.
 % data from these runs also help us conduct statistical tests.

We use one-sided permutation tests \cite{good2013permutation} to evaluate the relative
performance of \texttt{ARW}. If \texttt{ARW} performs better than a model on a dataset
with significance level $\alpha=0.01$ or $\alpha=0.001$, the corresponding cells in~\Cref{fig:exp_table}
are shaded gray ( \lightgraybg{ }) or dark gray (~\darkgraybg{ }) respectively.
We also group models that have similar edge formation mechanisms by color-coding the
corresponding rows in~\Cref{fig:exp_table}.  We use green ticks in~\Cref{fig:exp_table} to
annotate models that preserve assortativity up to two decimal places.
% The performance of a model depends on the effectiveness of its underlying
% edge formation mechanisms. Therefore,  we group models (i.e. color-coded rows in table \ref{fig:exp_table}) based on their
% underlying edge formation mechanism: preferential attachment (blue), preferential attachment with
% triangle closing (orange) and random walk (green) mechanisms.


~\Cref{fig:exp_table} shows that existing models fail to jointly preserve
{multiple} structural properties in an accurate manner. This is because existing
models either disregard important mechanisms such as triadic closure and homophily
or are not flexible enough to generate networks with varying structural properties.
% For instance, the preferential attachment model \texttt{DMS}
% can accurately fit the heavy-tailed degree distributions but does not
% account for local clustering.
% On the other hand, the attributed network model \texttt{SAN} tries to preserve
% all four properties but cannot do so accurately.

\textbf{Preferential attachment models}: \texttt{DMS}, \texttt{RL}
and \texttt{KA} preserve in-degree distributions but disregard
clustering. \texttt{DMS} outperforms other models in accurately modeling
degree distribution (\Cref{fig:exp_table}A) because its ``initial attractiveness''
parameter can be tuned to adjust preference towards low degree nodes. Unlike \texttt{KA}, however,
\texttt{DMS} cannot preserve global assortativity.
% \texttt{KA} outperforms \texttt{DMS} in preserving global assortativity because \texttt{KA}
% uses an attribute similarity parameter to model attribute mixing patterns.
However, by assuming that successive edge formations are independent, both models disregard
triadic closure and local clustering. (\Cref{fig:exp_table}B \&~\Cref{fig:exp_table}C).

\textbf{Triangle Closing Models}: \texttt{HK} and \texttt{SAN} are preferential attachment models
that use triangle closing mechanisms to generate scale-free networks with high average
local clustering.
% Note that \texttt{HK} and \texttt{KA} fit degree distributions with the same \texttt{KS} statistic
% (\Cref{fig:exp_table}A) because they lack parameters that can generate varying degree distributions.
While triangle closing leads to considerable improvement over \texttt{DMS}
and \texttt{KA} in modeling local clustering, \texttt{HK} and \texttt{SAN} are not flexible enough
to preserve local clustering in {all} datasets (see~\Cref{fig:exp_table}B \&~\Cref{fig:exp_table}C).
%  Nevertheless,
% barring one or two datasets in tables \ref{fig:exp_table}B and \ref{fig:exp_table}C,
% these models cannot accurately preserve the local clustering distribution and in-degree-clustering
% relationship observed in real networks.

\end{figure}

\textbf{Existing random walk models}: \texttt{FF}, \texttt{SK}, and \texttt{HZ}
cannot accurately preserve structural properties of real-world network datasets.
The recursive approach in \texttt{FF} considerably overestimates local clustering.
because nodes perform a probabilistic breadth-first search and link to \textit{all} visited/burned
nodes.
\texttt{SK} and \texttt{HZ} can control local clustering to some extent, as
nodes perform a single random walk and link to each visited node with tunable probability $\mu$.
However, both models lack control over the in-degree distribution. Furthermore, existing random walk models
disregard attribute homophily and do not account for attribute mixing patterns.


\textbf{Attributed Random Walk model}:~\Cref{fig:exp_table} clearly indicates the effectiveness
of \texttt{ARW} in {jointly} preserving multiple
global network properties. \texttt{ARW} can generate networks with tunable
in-degree distribution by adjusting nodes' bias towards high degree nodes
using $\pout$. As a result, \texttt{ARW} accurately preserves
in-degree distributions (\Cref{fig:exp_table}A), often significantly better
than all models except \texttt{DMS}. Similarly, \texttt{ARW} matches the local clustering
distribution  (\Cref{fig:exp_table}B) and in-degree \& clustering relationship
(\Cref{fig:exp_table}C) with high accuracy using $\pjump$ and
$\plink$. Similarly, \texttt{ARW} preserves attribute assortativity using
the attribute parameters $\psame$ and $\pdiff$.
Barring one to two datasets, \texttt{ARW} preserves all three properties significantly
better ($\alpha < 0.001$) than existing random walk models.


In ~\Cref{fig:barplot}, we show that \texttt{ARW} improves upon the average $\ell^2$-norm
of the second best performing model \texttt{SAN} by a significant margin of approximately 2.5x.
Existing models cannot jointly preserve multiple structural properties in
an accurate manner. For instance, consider the \texttt{APS} dataset. In~\Cref{fig:aps_fits},
we compare the structural properties of the \texttt{APS} network to the properties of the networks
generated by \texttt{ARW}, \texttt{SAN}, \texttt{HZ}, \texttt{DMS}; these models are collectively
representative of key edge formation mechanisms and perform best among competing models that rely on
similar mechanisms (e.g., preferential attachment). Clearly, \texttt{DMS} and \texttt{HK}
cannot explain the high local clustering in the \texttt{APS} dataset.
Conversely, \texttt{SAN} preserves local clustering distribution through its use of an attribute-augmented
triangle closing mechanism. However, by coupling triangle-closing to preferential attachment, \texttt{SAN} does not account
for the local clustering of the majority of nodes that have low in-degree.


% \Cref{fig:barplot} illustrates the performance of network models in jointly
% modeling degree distribution, local clustering distribution and in-degree-clustering
% relationship. Preferential attachment models \texttt{KA}, \texttt{DMS} and
% \texttt{RL} perform poorly because they do not preserve clustering. \texttt{HK}
% and \texttt{SAN} perform better than \texttt{KA}, \texttt{DMS} and
% \texttt{RL} because of edge formation mechanisms that close triangles
% to preserve clustering and its relationship with degree to some extent. The proposed
% model \texttt{ARW} outperforms existing random walk models \texttt{HZ}, \texttt{SK}
% and \texttt{FF} by a considerable margin. Also,
% \texttt{ARW} significantly improves upon the average $\ell^2$-norm of the second best performing model,
% \texttt{SAN} by a margin of 2.5x

To summarize, \texttt{ARW} unifies multiple sociological phenomena
into a single mechanism to jointly preserve key structural
properties of real-world networks.
