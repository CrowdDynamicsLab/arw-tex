\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}
In this paper, we model resource-constrained network growth model in which nodes
use a random walk process to form edges under constraints of limited information
and network access constraints. The problem is important because edge formation
in real networks is usually a local process. In typical network growth
scenarios, nodes in the network either have limited information about the other
nodes in the network or the system allows access to only restricted portion of
the existing network. It therefore becomes imperative to model how the local
processes of link formation gives rise to network characteristics. In this work,
we show that multiple structural properties of real networks can arise from the
local process of exploration and link formation. Our results indicate significant
improvement over the next best competing model \textsc{HZ}
\cite{herrera2011generating} by a significant margin.
