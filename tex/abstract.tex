This paper proposes an attributed network growth model. Despite the knowledge
that individuals use limited resources to form connections to similar others, we
lack an understanding of how local and resource-constrained mechanisms that
incorporate sociological factors explain the emergence of rich structural
properties found in real-world networks. We make three contributions. First, we
propose a parsimonious and accurate model of attributed network growth that
jointly explains the emergence of in-degree distributions, local clustering,
clustering-degree relationship and attribute mixing patterns. Second, our model
is based on biased random walks and uses local processes to form edges without
recourse to global network information. Third, we account for multiple
sociological phenomena---bounded rationality; structural constraints; triadic
closure; attribute homophily; preferential attachment. Our experiments indicate
that the proposed Attributed Network Growth (\texttt{ARW}) model accurately
preserves network structure and attribute mixing patterns of six real-world
networks; it improves upon the performance of eight state-of-the-art models by a
statistically significant margin of 2.5--$10\times$.

% We propose a network growth model based on local processes that jointly explains the
% emergence of key structural properties of real-world attributed directed networks:
% heavy-tailed indegree distribution, attribute mixing patterns, high local
% clustering and degree-clustering correlation.
% In real-world networks, individuals form edges
% under constraints of limited information and partial network access. However,
% well-known growth models that preserve multiple structural properties do not
% incorporate these resource constraints. Conversely, resource constrained growth models
% cannot jointly preserve multiple structural
% properties of real networks. Furthermore, most growth models disregard
% the effect of homophily on edge formation and global network structure.
% Our Attributed Random Walk (\texttt{ARW}) model explains how structural \&
% content-based properties of real-world networks jointly arise from individual
% preferences \& edge formation under constraints of limited information and network access.
% In our model, each node that joins the network selects a seed node from which it initiates a
% biased random walk to concurrently explore the network and link to existing nodes.
% At each step of the walk, the new node either jumps back to
% the seed node or chooses an outgoing or incoming edge to visit another node; It
% probabilistically links to each visited node and halts after forming a few
% edges
%
% Through our experiments, we observe that the proposed model \texttt{ARW} preserves
% network structure and attribute mixing patterns of six real-world networks
% Our experiments indicate that the proposed model \texttt{ARW} preserves global
% structural properties and attribute mixing patterns of six large-scale real-world
% networks significantly better than eight well-known models.
%
% Our experimental results against eight well-known growth models
% indicate significant improvement (2.5-10x) in accurately preserving global
% structural properties and attribute mixing patterns of
% six large scale real-world networks.
