This paper proposes an attributed network growth model. Despite the knowledge
that individuals use limited resources to form connections to similar others, we
lack an understanding of how local and resource-constrained mechanisms explain
the emergence of rich structural properties found in real-world networks. We
make three contributions. First, we propose an interpretable and accurate model
of attributed network growth that jointly explains the emergence of in-degree
distribution, local clustering, clustering-degree relationship and attribute
mixing patterns. Second, we make use of biased random walks to develop a model
that forms edges locally, without recourse to global information. Third, we
account for multiple sociological phenomena: bounded rationality; structural
constraints; triadic closure; attribute homophily; preferential attachment.
% We explore the parameter space of the proposed Attributed Network Growth (\texttt{ARW})
% to show each model parameter intuitively modulates network structure.
Our experiments show that the proposed Attributed Network Growth (\texttt{ARW}) model
accurately preserves network structure and attribute mixing patterns of
six real-world networks; it improves upon the performance of eight
well-known models by a significant margin of
2.5--$10\times$.
